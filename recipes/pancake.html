        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite. Original recipe made by dakota kelly extracted from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21014/good-old-fashioned-pancakes/">allrecipes.com</a></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1¼ cups milk</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li> 
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>  
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
